# Personal Website

A personal website built with VuePress 2 and deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Project Log
1. Initial project setup considerations:
   - Evaluated different static site generators:
     - Jekyll (Ruby-based) - Declined due to Ruby dependency
     - Static HTML/JS/CSS - Too basic, limited functionality
     - Hugo (Go-based) - Would require learning Go
     - Vuepress (Vue-based) - Selected for Vue.js ecosystem and markdown support
     - Docusaurus (React-based) - Not selected

2. Selected VuePress 2 for:
   - Vue.js integration
   - Markdown support
   - Built-in theme system
   - Plugin ecosystem
   - Static site generation for GitHub Pages
   - Hot-reloading during development
